Repository for FISH 549 Assignment 6 -- exploring R packages

## Package Title

RTMB

## Location

RTMB can be installed directly with `install.packaged("RTMB")` or through GitHub with `remotes::install_github("https://github.com/kaskr/RTMB", subdir="RTMB")`. 

## Vignettes

This package has both an introduction vignette and an advanced vignette. The advanced vignette goes over my head, even with familiarity to TMB, but the introduction vignette gives an overview on the differences between using TMB syntax and RTMB. 

## Applications

Are there any applications of the package, as demonstrated on a website like we built, someone’s blog, Twitter post, etc? If so, describe some of them.

## Review

Write a short (<300 words) review of the package. What is the primary purpose of the package (eg, is used for plotting, reading or scraping data, manipulating data, statistical modeling, etc)? What are the things you like about the package? Are there things you don’t like or wish it did differently? Was the package easy to learn how to use? Would you recommend this package to someone else?

### submission

need to add Mark as a collaborator -- once accepted, tag him in an issue that introduces your assignment and note "I am OK with Mark posting my review to the course website and he can use my name"
